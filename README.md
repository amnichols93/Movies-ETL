Module 8

## Written portion copied from challenge.py file:
Assumptions made in the following function:
Everything that is hard-coded assumes that the value will be the same for the next person who runs it.
  1) Column names
  2) Alternate title languages.
  3) The name of the raw date files
  4) All regular expressions used to filter the data were developed from exploring the data on-hand. Other csv files may require more or less strict filtering.
  5) That the dropped files are not needed for future analysis, e.g. we dropped the "adult" column, which may need to be factored later, even if unnecessary now.
